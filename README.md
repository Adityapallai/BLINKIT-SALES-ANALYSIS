## Key Analysis Areas
### 1. KPI Calculations
- Total revenue generated from all items sold
- Average revenue per sale
- Count of different items sold
- Average customer ratings

### 2. Visualizations
- *Sales by Fat Content Analysis*: Pie charts showing sales distribution by fat content
- *Total Sales By Item Types*: Bar charts comparing sales across product categories
- *Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales*: Non-Stacked column charts of sales by outlet type and fat content
- *Total Sales by Outlet Establishment*: Line Chart of sales by outlet Establishment Year
- *Sales by Outlet Size*: Pie charts of sales by outlet Size
- *Sales by Outlet Location*: Horizontal Bar Chart  of sales by outlet Location

## Business Insights
The analysis helps Blinkit:
1. Identify top-performing product categories and fat content types
2. Understand geographic sales patterns
3. Evaluate outlet performance by size and establishment year
4. Discover correlations between product attributes and customer ratings

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis
4. Check the reports folder for key findings

## Future Enhancements
- Add predictive modeling for sales forecasting
- Implement interactive dashboards with Plotly
- Include customer segmentation analysis

This project demonstrates comprehensive retail analytics skills including data cleaning, visualization, and business insight generation using Python's data science stack.
